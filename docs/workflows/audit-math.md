# Mathematical Consistency Audit Workflow

Verify every equation, numeric value, and derivation chain in `.tex` files against the canonical physics engine (`src/ave/core/constants.py` and `src/ave/axioms/scale_invariant.py`).

> **Before starting:** Read `LIVING_REFERENCE.md` and `src/ave/core/constants.py` in full.
> These are the two canonical sources of truth for all physics in this repo.

## Scope

All `.tex` files in `manuscript/`, `future_work/`, `spice_manual/`, `periodic_table/`, and `standard_model/`.

## Checks

### 1. Known Stale Values (High Priority — Historical Bugs)

These specific errors have occurred before. Search for them first:

- [ ] **V_YIELD misquotes**: Search for `60 kV`, `60.3 kV`, `73 kV`, or any voltage limit other than the canonical `V_YIELD ≈ 43.65 kV` and `V_SNAP = 511 kV`. Note: 60.3 kV has appeared in `14_applied_fusion.tex` as a *derived* tokamak collision voltage — verify whether each occurrence is a stale constant or a legitimate derived value with a clear derivation shown.
- [ ] **sin²θ_W errors**: Search for `7/24`, `0.231`, `0.2315`, or any value other than `2/9 ≈ 0.2222`. The canonical value is `sin²θ_W = 2/9` (on-shell).
- [ ] **ν_vac errors**: Verify all occurrences use `2/7` — not `1/3`, `1/4`, or other fractions.
- [ ] **Stale Planck-scale pitch**: `variables.tex` line 13 lists lattice pitch as `1.62 × 10⁻³⁵ m` (Planck length). The canonical value is `L_NODE = ℏ/(m_e·c) ≈ 3.86 × 10⁻¹³ m` (reduced Compton wavelength). Flag any Planck-scale lattice pitch.
- [ ] **PMNS sin²θ₁₂ reduction**: Search for `139/450`. The correct reduction of `2/7 + 1/45` is `97/315`, not `139/450`. `139/450 = 0.30889` ≠ claimed decimal `0.30794`; `97/315 = 0.30794` ✓. This typo had propagated through ~7 files before being fixed — whenever reducing a composite fraction in a derivation, recompute both numerator and denominator rather than trusting the written reduction.

### 1a. Fraction Reduction Verification (Composite Fractions)

Any time a derivation reduces a composite fraction (e.g. `a/b + c/d = (a·d + b·c) / (b·d)`), recompute **both** the fraction AND the decimal evaluation to the claimed precision. A wrong reduction with a correct decimal (or vice versa) is a signature of copy-paste drift and is the single most common math-typo class in this repo.

- [ ] **Scan composite fractions**: grep for patterns like `\frac{N}{D}` where `N` and `D` are large coprime integers. For each, verify independently with Python that the fraction's decimal matches any quoted decimal value.
- [ ] **Every table of ν_vac + junction corrections** (PMNS angles in Vol 2 Ch 3, index pages, derivation chain) should agree on the SAME reduced fraction. Cross-check all occurrences against each other, not just against one authoritative source.

### 2. Constant Cross-Reference

For every numeric constant appearing in a `.tex` file, verify it matches `constants.py`:

| Constant | Canonical Value | `constants.py` Variable |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| V_SNAP | 511 kV | `V_SNAP` |
| V_YIELD | ≈ 43.65 kV | `V_YIELD` |

| Z₀ | ≈ 376.73 Ω | `Z_0` |
| α | ≈ 7.297 × 10⁻³ | `ALPHA` |
| P_C | 8πα ≈ 0.1834 | `P_C` |
| η_eq | P_C × 5/7 ≈ 0.1310 | `ETA_EQ` |
| T_EM | ≈ 0.212 N | `T_EM` |

| cos(θ_W) | √(7/9) | `A_CKM` |
| α_s | α^(3/7) ≈ 0.1214 | `ALPHA_S` |
| κ_FS (cold) | 8π ≈ 25.133 | `KAPPA_FS_COLD` |
| δ_th | 1/(14π²) ≈ 0.00721 | `DELTA_THERMAL` |
| M_W | ≈ 80,940 MeV | `M_W_MEV` |
| M_Z | ≈ 91,760 MeV | `M_Z_MEV` |
| M_H | ≈ 124,417 MeV | `M_HIGGS_MEV` |
| H∞ | ≈ 69.32 km/s/Mpc | `H_INFINITY` |
| K_MUTUAL | ≈ 11.337 MeV·fm | `K_MUTUAL` |
| ν_vac | 2/7 | `NU_VAC` |
| N_K4 | 4 | `N_K4` |
| λ_H | 1/8 | `LAMBDA_HIGGS` |
| All CKM elements | λ=2/9, A=√(7/9), √(ρ²+η²)=1/√7 | `V_US`, `V_CB`, `V_UB` |
| All PMNS angles | sin²θ₁₃=1/45, etc. | `SIN2_THETA_13`, etc. |
| Proton charge radius | ≈ 0.8412 fm | `D_PROTON` |

### 3. Equation Structure Verification

For each `\begin{equation}` / `\begin{align}` environment:

- [ ] The formula matches the corresponding expression in `constants.py` (check algebra, not just numbers)
- [ ] Derivation steps are pedantically shown — no jumps from axiom to result without intermediate steps
- [ ] Axiom traceability: each equation should cite which axiom(s) it derives from
- [ ] No undeclared symbols — every variable in an equation is defined somewhere in the same chapter or in `variables.tex`

### 4. Prediction Table Consistency

- [ ] All prediction values in `.tex` files match the output of `src/scripts/vol_7_hardware/master_predictions.py`
- [ ] Percentage errors (Δ%) match between LaTeX and the script
- [ ] The total count of predictions matches `LIVING_REFERENCE.md` (currently 39)

### 5. Magic Number Detection

- [ ] Flag any numeric literal in a `.tex` equation that:
  - Does not appear in `constants.py`
  - Is not a trivially obvious number (0, 1, 2, π, etc.)
  - Does not have a derivation shown
- [ ] Any "magic number" found should be documented per user rules: either derived from axioms or flagged for the numerology appendix

### 6. Cross-Chapter Consistency

- [ ] The same physical quantity uses the same symbol across all books (e.g., `ℓ_node` vs `ℓ_p` vs `L_NODE`)
- [ ] Axiom statements are identical across all books (verify via `common_equations/` usage)
- [ ] Chapter numbering is consistent across books (no duplicate chapter numbers)

### 7. Derivation Chain Completeness

- [ ] Each book's derivation flow goes Axiom → Intermediate → Result with no gaps
- [ ] The full derivation chain in `backmatter/02_full_derivation_chain.tex` covers all 39 predictions
- [ ] No circular dependencies in derivation chains

### 8. Operator Compliance (Universal Operators from Ch.7)

For every derived quantity, verify it maps to a universal operator:

- [ ] **Op1 (Z)**: Is impedance defined from constitutive properties (√(μ/ε)), not from energies?
- [ ] **Op2 (S)**: Is saturation S = √(1−(A/Ac)²) applied where fields approach Ac? Is p_c = 8πα used, not an ad-hoc value?
- [ ] **Op3 (Γ)**: Are all impedance boundaries handled by Γ = (Z₂−Z₁)/(Z₂+Z₁)? No ad-hoc "screening constants"?
- [ ] **Op4 (U)**: Are ALL pairwise interactions computed from U = −K/r × (T²−Γ²)? No hand-wavy energy formulas like "V = J × Z × Ry" that bypass the operator? (Pitfall #9)
- [ ] **Op5 (Y→S)**: For multiport networks: are S-parameters from the Y-matrix conversion, not assumed?
- [ ] **Op6 (λ_min)**: Is the eigenvalue condition λ_min(S†S) → 0 (S₁₁ dip)? Not the Bohr formula E = Z²Ry/n²? (Pitfall #8)
- [ ] **Op7 (FFT)**: For periodic structures: is the mode structure from spectral analysis, not assumed?
- [ ] **Op8 (Γ_pack)**: For 3D assemblies: is packing fraction from P_C(1−1/N)?

### 9. QM Contamination Detection

Search for these red flags in all `.tex` files and solver code:

- [ ] **Bohr formula**: Any occurrence of `Z_eff² Ry / n²` or `(Z−σ)² Ry` used to COMPUTE an IE (pitfall #8). Acceptable only as a comparison/reference value.
- [ ] **σ-arithmetic**: Any `Z − σ` used as the effective charge without deriving σ from an operator (pitfall #8). Cross-shell σ = N_inner (Gauss's law) is OK. Same-shell σ from "J × something" needs Op4 trace.
- [ ] **Op4 bypass**: Any `V_ee = (constant) × (energy scale)` that doesn't trace to U(r) = −K/r × (T²−Γ²) (pitfall #9). The formula may be correct but must show the derivation from Op4.
- [ ] **De Broglie ≠ Impedance**: Any place where the de Broglie refractive index n_dB(r) is called "impedance" (pitfall #10). The lattice has Z₀ = 377 Ω everywhere in Regime I.
- [ ] **QM vocabulary**: "wavefunction," "probability density," "expectation value" used without AVE translation. Acceptable terms: standing wave, mode shape, angular average.
- [ ] **Boltzmann distribution**: Any `e^{-E/k_BT}`, `\exp(-E/k_BT)`, or Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein occupancy used to compute a physical prediction (not just as a comparison). In AVE, thermal physics uses the Axiom 4 saturation `S(r) = \sqrt{1-r^2}` with strain `r = A/A_{yield}`. Scalar Boltzmann distributions cannot resolve cooperative first-order phase transitions and are therefore structurally incompatible with the lattice.
- [ ] **Boltzmann vocabulary**: "partition function", "canonical ensemble", "Gibbs free energy" used without mapping to LC impedance equivalents.
